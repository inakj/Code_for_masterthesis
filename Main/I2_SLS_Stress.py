class Stress:

    '''Class to contain calculation stress calculation for prestressed cross section. Include calculations from both 
    Uncracked and Cracked Stress Class. All calculations are done according to the standard NS-EN 1992-1-1:2004 (abbreviated to EC2) and the 
    book "Betongkonstruksjoner; beregning og dimensjonering etter Eurocode 2" by Svein Ivar SÃ¸rensen.
